# THOR
Open-source atmospheric fluid dynamics solver optimized for GPUs.

The Exoclime Simulation Platform ([ESP][1]) develops a set of open-source codes
for research on exoplanets. The three parts of the ESP are
  - [HELIOS][2] radiative transfer and retrieval,
  - [THOR][3] atmospheric fluid dynamics,
  - [VULCAN][4] atmospheric chemistry.

THOR is still under heavy development and will be released later this year.
